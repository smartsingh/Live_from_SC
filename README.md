This project was created to analyze data that describes and measures the popular tv show 'Saturday Night Live' through a couple of different data sources. This data was scraped in September of 2019, cleaned up and transformed in Python, and then loaded into BigQuery before finally being connected to Looker for analysis. This repository contains the LookML for the analysis that was conducted upon the data. Numerous features were added in LookML to enhance the interactivity and depth of analysis, HTML links were created to provide context around sketches, Derived Tables were built to perform cohort analysis, and Liquid was utilized to achieve more dynamic queries. 

Below are some screenshots of Dashboards created using the LookML and Explores defined here.
